## Details

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The data comes in two files ie. `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` and `image_predictions.tsv`. It is also required to acquire retweet count and favorite count data from Twitter API. The data is also messy but contains valuable information about various dogs which one can gather insights after cleaning.
